# Hey this is my website that I spent November 2022-December 2022 working on.

Yeah.. I got a little demotivated making this. But it was a lot of fun learning javascript & css.
Gives me a lot more respect for front end developers after working through this.✌️

Some interesting facts about this project that nobody asked for:
```
  1) I never got to finishing the whole part where it actually shows my projects I've done.

  2) The red/yellow/green/gray dot on the website next to my profile picture is actually my discord presence and was created using an open sourced discord API called [lanyard]{https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard}. Very neat stuff actually.
  
  3) Had a very hard time with making everything fit into a screen. Need to learn how to make everything more organized and compact.
  
  4) Tried to make the website resemble a discord profile. Didn't really work out but eh.
```  
  
Regardless had a lot of fun working on this project and I do intend on finishing it when I get the time. ❤️
